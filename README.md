# NBA Match Outcome Predictor

This project builds **machine learning models** to predict the winner of an NBA match based on historical game statistics. It uses several classifiers (e.g., SVM, Random Forest, KNN, NB, and a Dummy classifier) to evaluate and compare predictive performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision-recall AUC, ROC AUC, and f1 score. The combination of statistical analysis and machine learning techniques provides insights into which models perform best and how performance trends evolve over time.

The full report of the project is avaiable [here](./basket_report.pdf)
